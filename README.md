# Gforcedev's Dotfiles
Initialised with the tutorial at https://www.ackama.com/blog/posts/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained

# Required installation
For full usage:

 - Zsh
 - [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - use the [PPA](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#ubuntu) if on Ubuntu, or the appimage (same page) is a failsafe for something like centos
 - [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) as an fzf.vim backend
 - [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for fzf.vim syntax highlighting
   - Currently broken if installing alongside Ripgrep on Ubuntu 20.04, requires a [workaround](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/938)
 - [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
 - [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
 - [Firacode Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for the Windows Terminal config
